# TrainsAndTracksTool
A little collection of perhaps useful little tools and gadgets for unity.

- Spline Tool: A small tool for creating splines in unity and letting things follow the generated track. (dont use it, there is a better free package in the store -> Dreamteck Splines)

- A Healthbar Component: an implementation for a health system, includes events for onDamage, onHeal, onHealthChange and onDeath. Supports different types of health representations (HealthBar ->normal unity slider, Hearts -> integer health represented as health(needs to be extended for half hearts etc), Shader -> a procedual healthbar shader (by https://github.com/josebasierra/procedural-healthbar-shader))

- A Menu template with options and scene transitions etc: to be done in the future

- A nice 2D jump: to be done in the future

- something with a shader: want to write one myself: TBD about what
